# YoloV3_KriaKV260
This project develops an object detection system on the Kria KV260 board using YOLOv3. Experiments include testing the Smart Camera app for face/pedestrian detection, deploying a quantized YOLOv3 on the FPGA, evaluating performance of the DPU with C++ script, and customizing DPU architecture in Vivado to analyze inference time.
